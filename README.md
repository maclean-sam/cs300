# Module 8 Journal Assignment

##### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For the projects in this course, I was working on a project for ABC University to help implement a program that allows students to easily view information on a course. Options for organizing course information included printing the course information for a specific course, ordering the courses alphanumerically, and displaying the prerequisite courses for a given course.
  
##### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by keeping the users in mind and using pseudocode to sketch out how the program should ideally work in the most efficient manner. I considered three different data structures which are all unique in how they work but ultimately went with the vector data structure since it is basic and the ideal choice for a small amount of data.

##### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I encountered many roadblocks while working through the projects and activities but used a combination of techniques to tackle the issues I came across. I used the CPP documentation quite a bit to figure out how certain functions work and took a break from the code to refresh my mind every once in a while. 

##### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work on this project opened my eyes to the various techniques that can be used to work my way through developing programs such as working on a block of code at a time and testing certain functions and methods by use of print statements and other problem solving techniques.

##### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The work on this project has evolved the way I write efficient programs by helping me realize that I need to keep the user in mind when developing code for a project and should verify that everything is in a desireable format that can easily be read. The code for this project has helped me identified the most practical approaches to developing code that is easy to interpret based on the comments and practical structures.
